# DoxrDev
## The GitHub user to the multiple @doxr accounts I go by.

I am on Replit (@doxr), I use Visual Studio Code (VSCode), and other accounts.
I mainly make games on HTML5 websites.
I like coding websites and I know html and CSS, and learning js (not really unless you count code.org)

## Stuff I made:
 - RedForceArmy
 - The Offline Games Hub
 - Redirector
 - Other stuff too
